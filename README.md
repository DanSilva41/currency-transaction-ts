## :dizzy: About

This application is designed with currency-based value conversion in mind, where the focus is to get the conversion rates from an [external api](https://exchangeratesapi.io),
perform the conversion calculations, persist the data and return to consistent data.
In addition to offering performance due to its reactive behavior, the application provides a way to consult the conversions already carried out by the user.

## :rocket: Technologies and motivation

The project was developed using the following technologies

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/): Is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/): As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions): As CI / CD process GitHub Actions provides a simple, powerful, integrated with various cloud providers and with the processing power and full feedback, therefore, it fulfills the final release of this product.
